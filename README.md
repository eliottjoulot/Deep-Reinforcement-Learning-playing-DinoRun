# Dino Run Tutorial

__A Deep Convolutional Neural Network to play Google Chrome's offline Dino Run game by learning action patterns from visual input using a model-less Reinforcement Learning Algorithm__

A 2013 publication by DeepMind titled ‘Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning’ introduced a new deep learning model for reinforcement learning, and demonstrated its ability to master difficult control policies for Atari 2600 computer games, using only raw pixels as input. In this project, will try to implement this paper using Keras to apply the very basics of Reinforcement Learning Algorithm.

*What is reinforcement learning?*

Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where a computer learns through trial-and-error. A software agent is usually placed in a simulation and given very few instructions. It then learns how to complete a goal by trying, failing, and trying again. For example, Google’s DeepMind used reinforcement learning to create an AI that can play Atari games.

# Installation 
Start by cloning the repository
<br>
<br>
`$ git clone https://github.com/Paperspace/DinoRunTutorial.git`
<br>
You need to initialize the file system to save progress and resume from last step.<br/>
Invoke `init_cache()` for the first time to do this <br/>


Dependencies can be installed using pip install or conda install for Anaconda environment<br><br>

- Python 3.6 Environment with ML libraries installed (numpy,pandas,keras,tensorflow etc)
- Selenium
- OpenCV
